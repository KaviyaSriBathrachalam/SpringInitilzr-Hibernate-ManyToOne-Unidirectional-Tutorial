STEP 1 : give the url which is mentioned in application properties and give the password and login.

STEP 2 : You will have employer and Employee table separately, 
          You cannot add an employee withut adding an employer 
          Because employer id  is given in employee table which is the foreign key mapping.
          
STEP 3 : You can add any number of emploees to an employer but there should be only one employer for many employees.
          because employee is many to one and employer is one to many(Though it is not mentioned it will not allow you to create).
 
STEP 4 : You cannot insert values to employee table unless you have created an employer.

STEP 5 : All the employee should have employer id which is present in the employer id table. Different employer id which is not in employer 
          table should not been given to employer id column of employee table.
          
          
STEP 5  :  After inserting as many values you are needed, now
            DELETION --
                  you cannot delete an employer without deleting all the employees under that particular employer id.
                  Each and every employee of that particular employer id must be deleted and then only employer can be deleted.

   This could be clearly understood only when you run the project and see the h2 db live.
