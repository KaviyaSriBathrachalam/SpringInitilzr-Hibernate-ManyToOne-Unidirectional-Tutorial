          employee can see his emploees whereas employer cannot see his employees
          
 BI-DIRECTIONAL -
     
        Emploee can see his Employer and Employeer can see all his employees.
        
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   
          Here, employee will have many to one but employer willl not be mentioned as one to many because 
it depends on the usecase of the user. here, it is like employee will be in one screen and employer will be in another sreen.

            but in event app event has one to many and agenda has many to one this means both event and agenda will be in same screen.
